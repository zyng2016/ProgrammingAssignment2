## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	yan <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                yan <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) yan <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() yan
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
	yan <- x$getInverse()
        if (!is.null(yan)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(yan)
        }
        msia <- x$get()
        yan <- solve(msia, ...)
        x$setInverse(yan)
        yan
}
